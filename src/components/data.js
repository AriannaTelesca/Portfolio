        THE MISSION:
        In the html file, you will find two data tables. Use JavaScript to traverse the DOM to insert right above each of these tables a representation of its data in the form of an interactive graph.
        Retrieve the data via Ajax, and use it to insert a graph that refreshes every second, just below the main title (h1) of the article.`,
